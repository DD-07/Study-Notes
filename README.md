# Study-Notes
---
2 parts to my study notes:
---
1. The notes itself

Notes for every subject are included, and I am collecting my own notes to preserve throughout my school years. --> Info from each year is **relevant**

Go to the year e.g. Year 3 --> then go to the subject --> e.g History

I will be either using txt format or md format for these notes - - will be linked to Google Doc versions - prob going to be in .docx format

FYI (This will be the most of the stuff in this repo)

---

2. Codeee?

So I like coding, and I have an interest in Game dev as well as Front end Web dev

I will be trying to make my own Productivity app - but due to a busy schedule I prob won't have time to work on it...

._.

I reall hope procrastination has been eliminated by the tenth time I'm editing this repo.
